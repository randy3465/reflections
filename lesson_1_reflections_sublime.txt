0.  	git --version: shows git version
0.1 	git clone followed with .git address == allows me to clone all revisions from web address
0.2 	git config --global color.ui auto == sets the output to color output.
0.3  	git log <<in the correct directory>> == shows history
0.4 	git diff <<new version old version>> == finds differences  


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
